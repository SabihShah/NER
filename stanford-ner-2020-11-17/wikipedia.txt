Khan began his acting career on the television sitcom, Jutt and Bond. He formed an alternative rock band, Entity Paradigm, with the show's co-stars and began his music career as its lead singer. The band appeared on the finale of Pepsi Battle of the Bands in 2002 and Khan became known for its 2003 debut album, Irtiqa. After about 250 performances, he left the band to pursue a film career. Khan made his film debut with a supporting role in the social drama, Khuda Kay Liye (2007), one of Pakistan's highest-grossing films.

He had his first success in television period drama, Dastaan (2010), for which he received the Best Male Actor Award at the Pakistan Media Awards. Khan played a lead role in the Pakistani television serial Humsafar (2011), and appeared in Sultana Siddiqui's family drama Zindagi Gulzar Hai (2012). For both performances, he received the Lux Style Award for Best Actor. Khan made his Bollywood debut with the romantic comedy, Khoobsurat (2014), for which he received the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. He further received critical praise for starring in the family drama Kapoor & Sons (2016), which earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Following a brief hiatus, Khan made a comeback with his Marvel Cinematic Universe debut in the miniseries Ms. Marvel (2022) as Hassan. His action-adventure film The Legend of Maula Jatt (2022) became Pakistan's highest-grossing film of all time.

Khan was born on 29 November 1981 in Karachi, Sindh.[3] He was born to a family of Pashtun background. His father was born in Patiala (present-day Punjab, India) whereas his mother's family was native of Lucknow (present-day Uttar Pradesh, India), who moved to Pakistan after the 1947 partition of British India.[4]  When Khan was young, his father was in pharmaceutical sales, which required the family to live in Athens, Dubai, Riyadh and Manchester during the Gulf War.[5][2] His family moved to Lahore, Punjab when he was 13.[6] He has two sisters; his older sister, Aliya, is an architect and his younger sister, Sana, is a physician.[7] He currently lives in Lahore.[8]

Khan studied at an American school, where he said he faced racial issues and was bullied because of his shy, calm, non-combative nature.[9] Khan passed his A-levels at the Lahore Grammar School, Johar Town (LGS JT), and received a bachelor's degree in software engineering from the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (NUCES) in Lahore.[10][11][12] Because he could not find a job as a programmer, he soon began acting.[13] In a Forbes India interview, Khan said that he had also failed to find a job in marketing.[14] By then he could play guitar, bass and drums, and became Entity Paradigm's lead singer.[15] Khan's first amateur performance was in the title role of a play, Spartacus.[16]

Khan's first television role was a bumbling spy named Bond with his bandmate, Ahmad Ali Butt, in the 2001 sitcom Jutt and Bond.[17][18] His debut film was Shoaib Mansoor's sociodrama Khuda Kay Liye, where he played a musician who is brainwashed by the local maulvi.[19] Although the film received positive reviews, critical response to Khan's performance was mixed. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama called it "strictly OK",[20] but The Economic Times' film critic Gaurav Malani found him "engaged" in the role of an extremist.[21] Released in 2007, the film grossed Rs.  250 million and is one of Pakistan's highest-grossing films.[22] Khan received the Lux Style Award for Best Actor – Film in 2008,[2] and appeared in the TV series Dil Deke Jaenge.[5] Later that year, in Anjum Shahzad's travel adventure TV series Satrangi, he played an engineer who goes on a road trip.[23][24][17] In 2010, Khan played a conservative, middle-class boy in the telefilm Aaj Kuch Na Kaho. Although it received negative reviews, Dawn found Khan "superbly convincing" and called him the film's "only redeeming factor".[25] That year, he starred with Sanam Baloch in Haissam Hussain's period TV series Dastaan. Based on Razia Butt's novel, Bano, its story (set in the 1940s) revolves around the separation of a young couple during the 1947 partition.[26] A Dawn reviewer wrote that Khan and his costars gave "superlative performances to match Samira Fazal's wonderful script",[27] and The Express Tribune praised the lead pair's onscreen chemistry.[28] For his performance, Khan won the Best Drama Actor award at the Pakistan Media Awards.[29]

Haissam Hussain's comedy Akbari Asghari, a modern adaptation of Mirat-ul-Uroos, was Khan's first television series in 2011; he played Asghar, an unambitious villager who wants to marry one of his cousins.[30] In an interview with The Hindu's Anuj Kumar, Khan described his character as "completely oaf[ish]".[31] In Kuch Pyar Ka Pagalpan, his third collaboration with Hussain, he starred with Sanam Baloch, Meekal Zulfiqar and Ayesha Khan as a computer engineer who wants to take over his uncle's business.[32][33] Khan later starred with Mahira Khan in Sarmad Khoosat's TV serial drama, Humsafar, for which he won the Best Actor award at the 2012 Lux Style Awards.[34] Humsafar is Pakistan's highest-rated television serial.[35] The series and Khan's performance were praised. Ranika Rajani praised Humsafar in The Indian Express, calling it a "breath of fresh air" and preferring it to Indian soap operas. According to Rajani, the lead pair's chemistry was the biggest factor in the show's success.[36] Zee News critic Ritka Handoo enjoyed the protagonists' performances, calling the Khans a "quite believable onscreen couple".[37]

Khan's first 2012 role was Rohail, a Turkish resident who goes to Pakistan to marry his cousin but instead marries her sister, in Sarmad Khoosat's Ashk.[38][39] That year, he played a member of an affluent family (with Sanam Saeed) in Sultana Siddiqui's family-drama TV series Zindagi Gulzar Hai. The serial, one of the most critically acclaimed Pakistani dramas, also received widespread praise in India.[40] Dipti Sharma of The Indian Express enjoyed Khan's skillful portrayal.[41] The role earned him several awards, including the Hum Award for Best Actor Popular and the Lux Style Award for Best Actor – Satellite.[42][43] Khan's last TV serial was Ahson Talish's sociodrama, Numm. Broadcast in 2013, Khan played a boy who secretly marries a girl in London and is forced to marry another girl when he returns to Pakistan.[44] Behadd, director Asim Raza's telefilm, featured Khan as a young divorcee who proposes to a widow who is the mother of a teenage girl.[45] The Times of India noted that Khan's character in Behadd was different from those in Humsafar and Zindagi Gulzar Hai, calling it "another benchmark".[46] His last telefilm was Anjum Shahzad's romance Armaan (with Aamina Sheikh), where he played a young, flirtatious boy.[47] He also co-wrote the telefilm's screenplay, with Vasay Chaudhry.[48]

Khan was originally expected to make his debut in India's Hindi film industry, commonly known as 'Bollywood', soon after the release of Khuda Kay Liye but the unstable political situation between India and Pakistan after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks delayed it.[49] He made his Bollywood debut in Shashanka Ghosh's 2014 comedy-drama, Khoobsurat, with Sonam Kapoor.[50] Khan played Vikram Singh Rathore, Kapoor's love interest and the son of her patient.[51] On Zee News, Ritika Handoo praised his "immensely polished acting skills" and said that he fit his character very well.[52] Deepanjana Pal of Firstpost liked Gosh's decision to make Khan's character a sex object, feeling that he blazed a trail for other male actors in similar roles.[53] The film was particularly well received in the UK, the UAE, and Pakistan because of Khan's following in those countries from his television work.[54][55] He received a Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut for his role in the film.[56]

Khan made a cameo appearance in Asim Raza's coming-of-age film, Ho Mann Jahaan, in January 2016.[57] He then had a main role in Shakun Batra's family drama, Kapoor & Sons. The film, which featured Khan as part of an ensemble cast including Rishi Kapoor, Ratna Pathak Shah, Rajat Kapoor, Sidharth Malhotra, and Alia Bhatt, was a commercial success. The actor received near-unanimous critical praise for his portrayal of Rahul Kapoor, a closeted homosexual writer.[58][59] A Bollywood Hungama reviewer enjoyed Khan's performance, saying that his character creates an emotional connection with the audience,[60] and NDTV film critic Saibal Chaterjee praised his self-assured performance.[61] Kapoor & Sons earned Khan the Diversity Award at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne[62][63] and a nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the 62nd Filmfare Awards.[64] According to the film's producer, Karan Johar, "We went to six actors and after six rejections, I told Shakun Batra (director) that we should drop the idea and he started developing another screenplay. Later, in a flash of thought Fawad came to my mind. I sent him the script, he loved it and said he would do it."[65] In September 2016, Johar said that Khan's wife pressured him to accept the role.[66] Later in 2016, Khan appeared in a small role with Ranbir Kapoor, Anushka Sharma, and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in Karan Johar's romantic drama, Ae Dil Hai Mushkil.[67] Raja Sen of Rediff.com found his role "far too little to justify the ridiculous kerfuffle his casting had caused", but called him the perfect choice for the part.[68] In Deccan Chronicle Subhash K. Jha described Khan's role as "meagre and sketchy".[69]

After the 2016 Uri terror attack, relations between India and Pakistan deteriorated and the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association (IMPPA) and the Film Producers Guild of India banned Pakistani artists from working in India until the situation normalised.[70]

In 2022, Khan made his acting comeback with his Marvel Cinematic Universe debut in Ms. Marvel as Hassan, Kamala Khan / Ms. Marvel's great-grandfather.[71]
